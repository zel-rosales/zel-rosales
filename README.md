### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Giselle, and I use they/them pronouns!
I am currently pursing a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction & User Experience (HCI/UX) at Drexel University.
Prior to this program, I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in the Digital Narrative & Interactive Design (DNID) program,
with minors in Computer Science and Korean language and culture. I also completed the Google UX Design Certificate online course.
